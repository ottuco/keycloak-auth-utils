  # `flake8` in `pre-commit` has some flaws
  #
  # Ref: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks/issues/112
  # `pre-commit` won't recognize the `.flake8` file or any config files.
  # This will lead to writing redundant configs in both files, which is not good, IMHO.
  # So, we will comment on this config here - But, either the developer
  # must run the flake8 check his own or must carry out the check during the PR/MR/Push, etc
